# ReactiveCocoaLayout

ReactiveCocoaLayout is a framework for describing Cocoa and Cocoa Touch layouts
in a reactive way, based on
[ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/github/ReactiveCocoa).

This framework is very much a work in progress at the moment, and should be
considered **alpha quality**. Breaking changes may happen often during this
time.

## Getting Started

To start building the framework, clone this repository and then run `git
submodule update --init --recursive`. This will automatically pull down any
dependencies.

## License

ReactiveCocoaLayout is released under the MIT license. See
[LICENSE.md](https://github.com/github/ReactiveCocoaLayout/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
